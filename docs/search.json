    "text": "Sep 1 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the drawer from working on iOS 10.\nChanging the page via push state will now also update the link[rel=canonical] tag.\nChanging the page via push state will now also update the meta[name=description] tag.\nFixed an issue that prevented the JS from building on Netlify.\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 18 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\nThis release adds Dark Mode for Hydejack PRO customers.\n\n\n\nRemoved cookie banner from free version\nRemoved offline support from free version\n\nIn an attempt to make the PRO offering more appealing, I’m removing features that arguably should have never been included in the free version. As software licenses go, nobody is stopping you from using the old code, but updates will no longer be included.\n\n\n\n\nThe cookies banners is now showing at the bottom of the page and its background color is no longer transparent to increase visibility\nChanged the default syntax theme from “GitHub” to “Atom One Light”\nAdapted figure CSS class to accommodate different children, not just imgs\nvideo tags now have a max-width of 100%\nIncreased margin before headings to 5rem, up from 4\nIncreased margin of hr elements.\nCookies banner can now be enabled without using Google Analytics\nClicking the cookie banner “Okay” button will now fire a hy--cookies-ok event on document, so that custom analytics solutions can plug in.\nAll Google Analytics code has been removed from Hydejack’s core and moved to _includes/body/analytics.js.\nAll Disqus code has been removed from Hydejack’s core and moved to _includes/comments.html and _includes/my-comments.html.\nUsing CSS Custom Properties instead of SASS variables for certain properties to enable style customization using only CSS.\nAdded shadow to sidebar\nNavbar is longer positioned fixed\n\n\n\n\n\n[PRO] Added Dark Mode\nborder CSS class\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 16 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\nSo far Hydejack has been a decent Jekyll theme, but with v8 it really starts stand out among the competition: Beautiful and unique landing pages, lazy-loading images, and experimental offline support are just the most prominent new features.\n\n\n\nThe expected format for sidebar images has changed. A sidebar image should now be a full-screen ~16:10 image.\nComment: The sidebar can now be fully extended on desktop, which generally requires a large landscape image to fill the entire window. To save bandwidth, you can blur the image on the left and right edges and save it as JPG.\nThe about and welcome layout no longer prepend the content with the author information. Instead, the author info can be shown by adding the &lt;!--author--&gt; marker to the top of the file. You can also place it anywhere else.\nComment: Showing the author description on the top of the welcome and about layouts felt like an imposition and was a left-over from when I was developing Hydejack primarily for myself.\n[PRO] The welcome layout no longer adds recent posts and projects to the bottom of the page. Instead, they have to be explicitly set using the &lt;!--posts--&gt; and &lt;!--projects--&gt; markers. The content_separator front matter opton is now ignored.\nComment: The old behavior felt arbitrary, and &lt;!--more--&gt; wasn’t a good name to be replaced with recent projects ands posts.\nSetting the accent color and sidebar image for an entire category/tag/author is no longer possible. To achieve a similar effect, use Front Matter defaults instead.\nE.g. to set the accent color and image for every post in the hydejack folder, use:\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path:         hydejack\n    values:\n      accent_color: rgb(38,139,210)\n      accent_image: /assets/img/hydejack-bg.jpg\nComment: The code to find the color for a given page was complicated and slow (potentially iterating all categories/tags to find the right one).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drawer now responds to mouse inputs.\nThe default heading font is now less bold. To restore the old behavior, edit (create if it’s missing) _sass/my-variables.scss and add $font-weight-heading: 700;.\nHydejack now uses lazy-loading hy-img tags instead of regular img tags. To revert to using regular images, set hydejack.no_img in the config file to true.\nCookie consent is now stored as a cookie (instead of LocalStorage) and expires after 1 year.\nScrolling to a fragment link is now smooth.\nFont loading now works differently, and will be cancelled on slow connections.\nThe sidebar content is now centered.\nThe sidebar will now show the site’s logo, which can be set in the config file under the logo key.\n[PRO] Updated embedded Bootstrap to v4.\n[PRO] Project cards now throw a shadow instead of having a border.\n\n\n\n\n\nPages can now have the cover key in the front matter. When set to true, the sidebar will be opened when visiting the page directly. E.g. https://hydejack.com/{:.no-push-state}\nAdded a _plugin that automatically replaces &lt;img&gt; tags with lazy-loading &lt;hy-img&gt; tags. If you don’t want images to load lazily, delete or rename the _plugins folder. Note that this plugin will never run when building the site on GitHub Pages.\nTo get the most out of this plugin, it is recommended to provide the width and height of the image, e.g.\n![Some image](assets/img/some-img.png){:data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\"}\nThis will cause hy-img to render a placeholder of 800 by 600 px, preventing the document height from changing after the image has finished loading.\nAdded experimental offline support via Service Workers. Use with care! For details, read the docs.\nAdded the figure CSS class, which allows images to have nicer-looking captions. E.g.\n![An image with a caption](https://placehold.it/800x50){:.lead}\nA caption to an image.\n{:.figure}\nClicking on a footnote will give its corresponding text a subtle highlight.\n[PRO] Projects can now have an optional end_date field in the front matter. The date is treated as the start date in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back button now works in combination with fragment links.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 2 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nMoved from browserify to webpack\nUpdated ruby dependencies\nUpdated JS dependencies\nUpdated hy-push-state and hy-drawer to latest versions\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 10 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nFixed an issue that caused the list layout to be empty after upgrading Jekyll\nUpdated dependencies\n\n\n\n\nApr 2 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nMoved from browserify to webpack\nUpdated ruby dependencies\nUpdated JS dependencies\nUpdated hy-push-state and hy-drawer to latest versions\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 18 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nAdded secondary legal nav in footer:\n# file: _config.yml\nlegal:\n  - title: Cookies Policy\n    href:  /cookies-policy/\n  - title: Foobar\n    href:  https://foobar.com/\nThe “heading permalink” can now be configured via strings.yml:\n# file: _data/strings.yml\npermalink:      Permalink\npermalink_icon: icon-link\nSections on resume layout can now be rearranged, e.g.:\n# file: resume.md\nleft_column:\n  - work\n  - volunteer\n  - education\n  - awards\n  - publications\n  - references\nright_column:\n  - languages\n  - skills\n  - interests\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed a bug that caused &lt;sup&gt; tags to render as regular text (#52)\nFixed a bug that caused Disqus to load the same thread on all pages (#53)\nFixed a bug that prevented Disqus comments to be loaded on sites that didn’t cause scroll events\nFixed a bug that caused Disqus to be loaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS.\nFixed a bug that caused an extra space in URLs (#55).\nComments no longer show up in the print version of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\nSet base font to 11pt in print layout.\nSet resume print layout to use 2 columns (A4 sheet)\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 1 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nDramatically improved resume print layout. It is now much less likely that there will be page breaks within logical units.\nFixed a bug that cause the page to break when setting no_drawer.\nFixed a bug that cased the “Random Posts” heading to appear, even when there are no posts to show\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 27 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nFixed storing user-related data before accepting cookies.\nFixed tab order of cookie banner, so keyboard users can access it more easily.\nAccepting cookies no longer causes a page reload in some browsers.\nFixed appearance of the okay button in the free version.\nMenu icon now useable while the cookies banner is active.\nLoading icon is now visible while the cookies banner is active.\nRemoved cookies banner from print layout.\nRemoved inline styles from cookie banner.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 25 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nAllow markdown in copyright string\nAdded theme_color front-matter property to micro-manage the value of the the theme-color meta tag. When not set, will use accent_color.\nAdded theme_color site setting, to set the value of themeColor in the app manifest. When not set, will use accent_color.\nAdded cookies_banner setting:\n# file: _config.yml\nhydejack:\n  cookies_banner: true\nEnabling this setting will show a notice at the top of the page to new visitors. You can change the wording of the notice in _data/strings.yml with the cookies_banner.text and cookies_banner.okay keys:\n# file: _data/strings.yml\ncookies_banner:\n  text: This site uses cookies.\n  okay: Okay\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawer no longer resizes/repaints in iOS Safari (iPhone) and Chrome for Android when the address bar autohides.\nFixed a bug that caused the drawer flicker/open unexpectedly when scrolling in mobile browsers.\nFixed how image works when using the jekyll-seo-tag plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged how line breaks work in resume layout\nChanged margins of horizontals lines\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated docs\nUpdated posts\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 17 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nAllow markdown content on projects layout.\nRenamed big_project option on projects to featured (big_project still works)\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed default font weights\nFixed hard-coded /projects/ URL in project layout\nLink to feed.xml is only generated when using the jekyll-feed plugin\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 13 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nAdded _sass/my-variables.scss file, which you can use to selectively override SCSS variables.\nFont weights can now be configured via SCSS variables:\n\n$font-weight for normal font.\n$font-weight-bold for strong tags and similar.\n$font-weight-heading for headings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage boxes will no longer span the full width, even with the break layout feature enabled.\nIncreased space between project card rows, so they look less like a brick wall.\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced the draw range of the drawer on iOS, so that a larger portion of the screen is available for zooming (a11y).\nDefault images are now optimized, so they are no longer flagged by Google PageSpeed Insights and similar tools.\nQuery parameters are no longer used for cache busting. Instead, the version number is no part of the file name for the CSS and JS resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 3 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nFix IE11 feature detection\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 2 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nRenamed no_description to hide_description. Since this feature isn’t yet documented outside of the change log, the old name will not continue to work.\nWhen providing images to image, image.path, image.src, image.srcset and accent_image, it is no longer necessary to prepend the url with the baseurl of the site, e.g. values like accent_image: /assets/img/sidebar-bg.jpg are now valid.\nLimited scope of a and img styles to content areas.\nUpgraded KaTeX to v0.8.3\nUpgraded jekyll-relative-links to v5.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\nfont and font_heading are now properly set when using the no_inline_css option #47.\nFixed default values for image and logo that were referring to non-existing images.\nAdded missing JS dev dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated documentation\nUpdated index, download, about and README pages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 27 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nRemoved readme files from assets that would show up as pages when building on GitHub Pages #42.\nDisabled push state on Firefox for iOS\nChanged some default settings in _config.yml\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved outdated example script in my-scripts.html\n\n\n\n\nOct 24 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\nThe free version of Hydejack is now GPL-3.0 licensed, which is a more restrictive license than MIT (but still Open Source). This was necessary because the two major components that make up Hydejack, hy-push-state{:.external} and hy-drawer{:.external}, are now GPL licensed in turn.\nHow will this affect you? * If you bought the PRO version you are not affected at all. * You can continue to use previous versions of Hydejack according to their license (MIT). * If you upgrade, keep the source code in a public repository and make sure you include the new LICENSE.md file. DO NOT publish the new code with an old license. * If you upgrade and make changes to the source code, you are required to make those changes available to the public under a GPL-3.0 compatible license.\nThe full license text is available here. You can read a summary on tl;drLegel.\nIf this change is not acceptable to you, DO NOT upgrade or consider buying a PRO license.\nNote that the above does not constitute legal advice.\n\n\n\nThis is a major release, but almost all options and APIs that were described in the docs continue to work. Some names have changed and are no longer mentioned in the docs, but they are still part of the code and continue to work.\nThat being said, you should be aware of these (small) breaking changes:\n\nThe favicon is now located in assets/icons. To change the favicon of the page, edit favicon.ico (png) in the folder.\nChanged the way tables work, so that they do the right thing more often. Tables are now scrollable by default, but small tables are no longer stretched to span the full width. Setting scroll-table on a larger table is sill recommended, as it will set white-space: nowrap.\nAutogenerated ids for posts now look like post-2017-01-01-my-title instead of post-2017/01/01/my-title.\nEvent names described in the scripting chapter have changed from y-push-state-* to hy-push-state-*, except y-push-state-animationend, which has been removed. See the docs for more.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage has been renamed to accent_image, but image continues to work unless you add the jekyll-seo-tag plugin. This change was necessary because jekyll-seo-tag uses the image keyword to set the thumbnail image of a page. While it may be desirable to use the same image for both the sidebar and the thumbnail, the new preferred way to set sidebar images is by using the accent_image key.\ncolor has been renamed to accent_color to be consistent with the new accent_image key, but color continues to work.\nVarious options that do not make sense outside the context of Hydejack (like no_push_state or no_drawer) have been moved under a common hydejack key. However, the old options continue to work.\nhydejack:\n  no_push_state: false\n  no_drawer: false\nAll plugins (gems) are now optional. The gem-based version of the theme no longer uses any plugins by default, while the download version follow a “batteries-included” approach and enables some by default.\nLinks to the /assets/ folder are no longer intercepted by the push state features, which means clickable images and download links should work fine now.\nReader views in Firefox and Safari have an easier time recognizing the main content.\nInternal No more &lt;style&gt; tags in the body.\nInternal Content that is generated via JS (error pages, loading, etc…) is now cloned from template tags, where it is easier to modify (but before you do, check out the new _data/strings.yml file).\nInternal Changed how CSS code is organized. Previously there were two versions of each CSS file for each ‘topic’, one containing core styles to be inlined into the page, the other containing those fetched asynchronously via link tag. Now there is only one file per topic, with the parts to be inlined/linked marked with comments. A script has been added to “split” the CSS into the inline/link parts. Note that this does not affect your my-*.scss files.\nInternal Many CSS classnames have changes, specifically those that would conflict with Bootstrap class names.\nInternal Many files in _includes have been reorganized, specially head.html and body.html have been broken up into smaller parts.\nInternal The y-drawer component (MIT) has been replaced with the hy-drawer component (GPL-3.0).\nInternal The y-push-state component (MIT) has been replaced with the hy-push-state component (GPL-3.0).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme now has support for the jekyll-seo-tag plugin. To use this gem, make sure you use the latest Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and run bundle install. In your config file, add jekyll-seo-tag to plugins (formerly called gems).\nAll texts that were previously hard-coded into the theme can now be configured via _data/strings.yml. This makes it possible to change certain phases without having to change source files, but it should also make it easier to use Hydejack with other languages. Time and date formats can also be configured, using Ruby’s format directives.\nThe lang key now accepts values like en-us or de_AT.\nMade the site “mobile web app capable”\n\nAdded manifest.json for “Add to Homescreen” support on Android\nAdded theme-color meta tag that matches the accent_color and changes dynamically\nAdded apple-mobile-web-app-* meta tags\nAdded ieconfig.xml for “Pin to start menu” support in Windows 10.\nOld icons and new ones are now located in assets/icons.\n\nHydejack now marks up content as structured data, to the extent possible. The resume is provided as https://schema.org/Person as well as hCard, while projects are provided as https://schema.org/CreativeWork. You can use the Structured Data Testing Tool to see the results.\nIf you do not want to expose your data in machine-readable form, you can set the no_structured_data flag to true in your config file.\nhydejack:\n  no_structured_data: true\nNote that this only applies to the resume and project layout, not the data generated by by jekyll-seo-tag (Facebook Open Graph and Twitter cards).\n[PRO] Added “big projects”. You can make a project card span the entire content width (instead of half), by setting big_project to true in the project’s front matter.\n[PRO] The welcome layout now has a content_separator option, which allows content to move below the “Selected/Latest Projects” and “Selected/Latest Posts” section. Usage:\n---\nlayout: welcome\ncontent_separator: &lt;!--more--&gt;\n---\n\nContent above\n\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n\nContent below\n[PRO] The PRO version now has built-in support for Tinyletter. To show a newsletter subscription box below each post, set tinyletter: &lt;username&gt; in your config file. If you want to use a different mailing provider, you can add your own form in _includes/my-newsletter.html.\n[PRO] The PRO version now includes styles for input elements, using the same CSS class names as Bootstrap. Check out the Bootstrap docs to learn more.\n[PRO] Added links to random posts at the bottom of each post. This can be beneficial for search engine rankings and content discovery. You can remove them with the new post_addons option (see below).\n[PRO] If a endDate is missing in your resume.json, it will render as “&lt;startDate&gt; – present”. You can change the wording in the new strings.yml file.\nAdded support for jekyll-avatar. If this plugin is enabled in your config file, it will show the avatar of your github account (author.social.github, author.github.username author.github).\nAdded support for jekyll-gist.\nYou can now add links to external sites in the sidebar. Create a file like something.md and add a title, menu, order (optional) and a redirect_to field to the front matter, e.g.:\n---\ntitle: External\nmenu: true\nredirect_to: https://example.com/\n---\nYou may combine this with the jekyll-redirect-from plugin to generate a redirect page, but this is optional.\nYou can now configure the order of complementary content below posts and projects. By default, Hydejack will show the author first (if any), the newsletter box next (if any), and related posts/projects last.\nhydejack:\n  post_addons:    [about, newsletter, related, random]\n  project_addons: [about, newsletter, other]\nTo change the order in the output, change to order in the array. You can also drop entries from the output by removing them from the list.\nAdded an error page that is shown when client-side network errors occur. It contains a link to retry loading the page. Previously, the browser’s default error page would have been shown.\nAdded hide_description option to pages to prevent the content of description fields to show up in the output. This allows you to use the description field in the front matter to set descriptions for search engines and sharing on social media, without having to worry about the output.\nYou can activate this for all pages by adding to your config file:\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: ''\n    values:\n      hide_description: true\nAdded a new option called no_inline_css. When true, Hydejack will generate a single CSS file to be fetched (synchronously) via link tag, instead of inlining half and including the rest via link tag.\nThis option may be useful when serving content over HTTP/2, but you should perform your own tests. For more on inlining CSS, see this.\nhydejack:\n  no_inline_css: true\nAdded dns-prefetch links to Google Fonts and Google Analytics domains to further boost page load speed. These are only included when using Google Fonts/Analytics.\nYou can now define an arbitrary CSS background for the sidebar instead of just images, e.g.:\naccent_image:\n  background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(35,62,76,1) 0%,rgba(60,146,158,1) 50%,rgba(213,213,212,1) 100%) #4fb1ba'\nCategory and tag pages can now have arbitrary content (to be shown above the list).\nLinks can now be marked for FLIP animations by adding the flip-title class. Use this for links that have the exact same text as the title of the page they are linking, e.g. [NOTICE](NOTICE.md){:.heading.flip-title}.\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced building time during development. Roughly 50% of the time was spent rebuilding the inline CSS, which is now built once and included via link tag. Production builds still inlines CSS, so the building speed remains unchanged. For more on how to improve building speeds, see here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default background image is no longer anti-selling the theme…\nCode blocks, math blocks and tables now use as much space as there is available on the screen. Limiting the line length makes sense for paragraphs, as they are more difficult to read when they span the entire length on a large display, but it is less useful for content, like tables, long formulas or code.\nIf you do not like this change, you can set no_break_layout to true in your config file.\nhydejack:\n  no_break_layout: true\nMargin below code blocks, math blocks and tables increased from 1rem to 2rem.\nGray text now has a higher contrast ratio: I don’t want anybody to “suffer from design”.\nReduced the number of responsive breakpoints.\nAdded a hover effect on project images.\nOn mobile, footnotes will be shown as [1] instead of superscript, making them easer to tap.\nThe sidebar now has a subtle shadow on mobile, to indicate that it can be drawn from the side.\nThe sidebar now has less margin on the sides.\nThe sidebar now fits 5 social media icons, up from 4.\nThe description in the sidebar now has a smaller font size when it is longer than 100 characters. This is to encourage writing a longer description for search engines (~160 characters).\nh1, h2 and h3 headings now have different line-heights to improve readability when they span multiple lines.\nMarks on external links are now less opaque, but have a hover effect.\nMore responsible usage of font_heading in resume layout.\nWhen hovering over a headline, a # link will appear, so that readers can link to individual headlines.\nChanged the loading spinner to use a single icon instead of several animated divs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen linking to an internal document that doesn’t match the regular content structure, the ‘hot replacement’ will no longer get stuck, and reload the page instead.\nFix jumping to # links after navigating to a new page.\nFix jumping to # links in MS Edge.\nFixed a bug on iOS were scrolling was blocked after closing the drawer.\nFixed a bug where the image used during the project FLIP animation would note be replaced with the higher resolution image after the animation in certain browsers.\nThe drawer is now less likely to be opened by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 10 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nFixed sending incorrect paths to Google Analytics. In previous versions, Hydejack would always send the URL of the initial page for all subsequent page views. Thanks @dannydwarren for pointing this out.\nFixed tagline not showing up in the title.\n\n\n\n\nAug 7 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nDependencies from external domains have been removed (with the exception of those that are explicitly defined and optional: Google Analytics, Google Fonts and Disqus). Instead, they are now located in the assets folder and managed via Bower.\nKaTeX is no longer loaded on pages that do not contain math blocks.\npreload link tags no longer use onload. Instead callbacks are registered within a script tag.\nCode in code blocks is no longer smaller sized than inline code. To undo this change, open (or create) _sass/my-inline.scss and add the following:\npre code { font-size: .75em; }\nAdded _includes/my-head.html, to make it easier to add things to the &lt;head/&gt; without modifying the source. This is especially useful when using the gem-based version of the theme.\n\n\n\n\nJul 27 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nThis maintenance release includes various quality-of-life improvements when using the gem-based version of the theme.\n\n\n\nHydejack now uses additional Jekyll plugins by default, which make working with GitHub more convenient. They have been added to the Gemfile and _config.yml. Note that existing users need to update their _config.yml:\ngems:\n  - jekyll-default-layout # new\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jekyll-optional-front-matter # new\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-redirect-from\n  - jekyll-relative-links # new\n  - jekyll-sitemap\nAdded licenses folder that includes the full license texts of licenses mentioned in NOTICE.md.\nYou can, once again, define the author in _config.yml. Using _data/authors.yml is still recommended (and takes precedence), but this option is more convenient when setting up a quick (project-) page using the gem-based theme. Also, a mini-version of _data/social.yml can be provided as part _config.yml, e.g.:\nauthor:\n  social:\n    github: https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack\n    npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydejack\n    download: https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/archive/v6.5.0.zip\n\ndata_social:\n  github:\n    name: GitHub\n    icon: icon-github\n  npm:\n    name: npm\n    icon: icon-npm\n  download:\n    name: Download\n    icon: icon-box-add\nA download icon has been added to the default icon font and _data/social.yml has been updated.\nAdded _includes/my-scripts.html, _sass/my-inline.scss and _sass/my-style.scss to make it easier to add custom scripts and styles without modifying the source. This is especially handy when using the gem-based version of the theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading web fonts now starts earlier and content download no longer blocks swapping out the fallback font for the new font. Previously, a page containing lots of images could have delayed displaying the web fonts significantly.\nThe home layout no longer contains a message suggesting that you don’t use it.\nThe home layout now shows up to 5 blog posts and up to 5 pages blow the regular content.\nThe version history has been moved from docs/&lt;version&gt;/versions.md to CHANGELOG.md.\nThe license notices have been moved from docs/&lt;version&gt;/licenses.md to NOTICE.md.\nUpdated gem and npm dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default font has been changed from “Noto Serif” to “Noto Sans”. If you have a font entry in _config.yml, this will have no effect.\nnap.jpg is no longer used as default background image in the gem-based theme.\nThe sidebar content width is now limited to the width of the sidebar (this only effects large screens).\nProject cards and pagination buttons now have slightly rounded borders for a less “rigid” look.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to use the old font, add the following to _config.yml:\nfont_heading: \"'Roboto Slab', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\"\nfont:         \"'Noto Serif', Georgia, serif\"\ngoogle_fonts: \"Roboto+Slab:700|Noto+Serif:400,400i,700,700i\"\nIf you were relying on the default setting for the background image, add the following to _config.yml:\nimage: /hydejack/assets/img/nap.jpg\nNote that you have to replace /hydejack with your baseurl.\nTo restore the old sidebar, open (or create) _sass/my-inline.scss and add the following:\n@media screen { .sidebar-sticky { left: 2rem; max-width: none; } }\nTo remove the border radius, open (or create) _sass/my-inline.scss and add the following:\n.card, .pagination-item { border-radius: 0!important; }\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 23 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nFix invalid color hex\n\n\n\n\nJun 21 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nIn this release I’ve added a “Other Projects” section to the bottom of each project page, making it easier for users to navigate through your collection and discover other projects. Also, it’s now possible to display larger (data-) tables that were previously cut off (especially on mobile devices).\nFor more on how to add tables, see the new section in docs/writing.\nSmaller changes include a reduced usage of horizontal lines and a more “semantic” use of hr elements. Specifically, the semantics of the resume layout have been improved.\n\n\n\nAdded “Other Projects” section to the bottom of the project layout (similar to “Related Posts”)\nAdded CSS classes that make viewing larger (data-) tables possible\nAdded section on tables to docs/writing\nReduced use of &lt;hr/&gt; elements, using CSS borders instead.\nImproved semantic HTML of resume\nFollow favicon best practices and include example icons\nAdded no_google_fonts option\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced number of horizontal lines, making many layouts feel less “cluttered” (esp. blog layout)\nMade link hover styles consistent across the board\nVisually separated thead and tbody and tfoot within tables.\nChanged RSS and email icons\nRemoved top margin for consecutive headings, e.g. when using h3 immediately after h2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed bug that caused inline math to be moved to the end of a paragraph when dynamically loading a page.\nFixed bug that caused layout to break in IE11.\nFixed bug that caused the project animation to “jump” when using long project titles.\nNo more empty attributes on img tags.\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 6 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nThis release makes including third party plugins easier. Until now, the push state approach to loading new pages has been interfering with embedded script tags. This version changes this by simulating the sequential loading of script tags on a fresh page load.\nThis approach should work in a majority of cases, but can still cause problems with scripts that can’t be added more than once per page. If an issue can’t be resolved, there’s now the option to disable push state by setting disable_push_state: true in config.yml.\n\n\n\nSupport embedding script tags in markdown content\nAdd disable_push_state option to _config.yml\nAdd disable_drawer option to _config.yml\nRename syntax highlighting file to syntax.scss\nAdded chapter on third party scripts to documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd subtle intro animation\nRename “Check out X for more” to “See X for more” on welcome* page\nReplace “»” with “→” in “read more”-type of links\n\n\n\n\n\nFix default color in gem-based theme\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 29 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nChanged default color and image\nUpdated demo content\nFinalized welcome and project page\nColor is now fading correctly when no background image is provided\nAdded exemplary usage of excerpt separator\nRemoved social media links from welcome and about page\nUpdated dependencies\n\n\n\n\nMay 23 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nAdd support for lang in front matter and _config.yml.\nAdd support for keywords in front matter and _config.yml.\n\n\n\n\nMay 15 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\nUpdated JS dependencies\nAdded version history and licenses to documentation\nFixed print layout\n\n\n\n\nMay 3 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nHydejack has always featured a JavaScript-heavy sidebar, but other than that, JS has been used sparingly. This changes with this release, which adds a ton of (optional) code that changes the feel of the theme dramatically.\n\n\nPages are now loaded and swapped through JavaScript. This has a number of effects. First of all, it looks cool, but the animations aren’t just about aesthetics: They also help to hide the network time of fetching the next page, making the entire site feel faster. At the same time, the FOUC introduced in the last release will no longer occur (except on the initial page load).\n\nMost JS is now unified in the _js directory and written in ES2016.\nThe blog-by-tag layout has been renamed to list.\npublic folder has been renamed to assets to make the theme compatible with Jekyll’s gem-based themes.\nTags are now supported via Jekyll Collections instead of _data.\nThe sidebar can now add links to all kinds of pages.\nCategories are now supported.\nAuthor information moved to _data/authors.yml\nAdded support for multiple authors.\nUsing jekyll-feed plugin (supported on GitHub Pages) instead of custom solution.\nAdded about layout.\nAdded not-found layout.\nAdded redirect layout\n\nSee the the migration guide for instructions on how to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nThe “accent” font (heading font) is now used for all headings. This gives the theme a “bolder” look and was necessary for the animation: link =&gt; heading.\nChanged default text font from “PT Serif” to “Noto Serif”.\nAdded CSS classes for styling markdown content.\nLinks have a new style. They now always display an underline to make the choice of the link color less critical (darker colors were hard to distinguish from regular text).\nMade social media icons larger and easier to tap.\nSocial media icons are now also part of the “about” sections of a post.\nAdded support for a copyright notice at the bottom. Can be set via the config variable copyright.\nChanged responsive breakpoints and added support for very large displays.\nThe site is now printable.\nThe blog layout now only shows the excerpt instead of the full post.\nLinks to external pages are now marked with a symbol.\nAdded margin above social media icons to prevent accidental tapping\nAdded gem files so that bundle install and bundle exec jekyll serve work\nDisabled HTML minification when running via jekyll serve\nAdded dingbat to signal end of post\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated posts is no longer blank for posts that do not belong to a category.\nFootnotes now use the text version of “leftwards arrow with hook” instead of the emoji on iOS.\nText is no longer invisible while waiting for Google Fonts to load.\nAlways show scrollbar to prevent layout “jumps”\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 1 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\na11y improvements - Use HTML5 semantics tags + roles - Don’t set maximum-scale=1 - Fix bug with sr-only class\nMath support improvements - LaTeX syntax errors will no longer prevent correct math blocks from being rendered - LaTeX syntax errors logged to console\n\n\n\nSep 29 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\nPrevent structural FOUC\n\n\n\nSep 28 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\nCross-browser compatibility improvements: - Added features tests - Fixed layout in IE 10 and 11 - Disabled stylesheets and JS in IE 9 and below.\n\n\n\nSep 16 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\nThis major release increases page load speed dramatically. The page now scores roughly 90/100 on Google’s PageSpeed Insights (up from ~50) and has a high score on similar tools.\nMost importantly, the critical rendering path is no longer blocked by loading styles or scripts, meaning the site becomes visible faster.\nPage load speed matters to Google, but is also very apparent to visitors with slow internet connections.\nHowever, as a side effect of these optimizations, the site now has a visible FOUC. Future versions might address this, but it is the currency in which loading speed is being payed for and can not be fully avoided.\n\n\n\nHTML, CSS and JS served minified.\nJS downloading starts only after the rest of the page is renderd.\nCritical CSS (above-the-fold) is inlined into the document, the rest is fetched later.\n\nIn order to minify the CSS and make it more modular it has been rewritten in SCSS.\n\n\n\n\nColored focus outline in page color\nTabindex for tab navigation\nSocial media icons easier tappable with finger\n\n\n\n\nNot strictly part of the release, but the images have been blurred to increase text readability and help with loading speed as well (burred images get compressed by JPG much better).\n\n\n\n\nSep 11 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\nFix per-page color and image\n\n\n\nAug 30 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nStructure of _config.yml has changed\n\nSocial media usernames are now located under author: social: &lt;platform&gt;: &lt;username&gt;.\ndisqus is now a top-level entry (moved from author).\nNow has font, font_accent and google_fonts fields that are mandatory.\n\nNow defaults to the blog layout, old style is available via blog-by-tag layout, see archive.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded a lot of social media icons, configurable via _config.yml.\nNew blog layout. Classic, paginated.\nFonts are configurable via _config.yml.\n\n\n\n\n\nLink underlines are now fixed-sized for all font sizes (no thicker lines for headlines, etc)\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly set the meta description field using either the description field or post.excerpt as a fallback (used to contain the unmodified markdown).\nFixed various URL bugs relating to site.baseurl.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefactoring, preventing code duplications, heavier usage of includes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 7 2016 {:.heading.post-date}\nHydejack is a pretentious two-column Jekyll theme, stolen by @qwtel from Hyde. You could say it was.. hydejacked.\n\n\nUnlike Hyde, it’s very opinionated about how you are going to use it.\nFeatures include: * Touch-enabled sidebar / drawer for mobile, including fallback when JS is disabled. * Github Pages compatible tag support based on this post. * Customizable link color and sidebar image, per-site, per-tag and per-post. * Optional author section at the bottom of each post. * Optional comment section powered by Disqus. * Layout for posts grouped by year * Wide array of social media icons on sidebar. * Math blocks via KaTeX.\n\n\n\n\nJan 2 2014 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\n\nOct 15 2013 {:.heading.post-date}"

    "text": "Jul 16 2018 {:.heading.post-date}\nSo far Hydejack has been a decent Jekyll theme, but with v8 it really starts stand out among the competition: Beautiful and unique landing pages, lazy-loading images, and experimental offline support are just the most prominent new features.\n\n\n\nThe expected format for sidebar images has changed. A sidebar image should now be a full-screen ~16:10 image.\nComment: The sidebar can now be fully extended on desktop, which generally requires a large landscape image to fill the entire window. To save bandwidth, you can blur the image on the left and right edges and save it as JPG.\nThe about and welcome layout no longer prepend the content with the author information. Instead, the author info can be shown by adding the &lt;!--author--&gt; marker to the top of the file. You can also place it anywhere else.\nComment: Showing the author description on the top of the welcome and about layouts felt like an imposition and was a left-over from when I was developing Hydejack primarily for myself.\n[PRO] The welcome layout no longer adds recent posts and projects to the bottom of the page. Instead, they have to be explicitly set using the &lt;!--posts--&gt; and &lt;!--projects--&gt; markers. The content_separator front matter opton is now ignored.\nComment: The old behavior felt arbitrary, and &lt;!--more--&gt; wasn’t a good name to be replaced with recent projects ands posts.\nSetting the accent color and sidebar image for an entire category/tag/author is no longer possible. To achieve a similar effect, use Front Matter defaults instead.\nE.g. to set the accent color and image for every post in the hydejack folder, use:\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path:         hydejack\n    values:\n      accent_color: rgb(38,139,210)\n      accent_image: /assets/img/hydejack-bg.jpg\nComment: The code to find the color for a given page was complicated and slow (potentially iterating all categories/tags to find the right one).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drawer now responds to mouse inputs.\nThe default heading font is now less bold. To restore the old behavior, edit (create if it’s missing) _sass/my-variables.scss and add $font-weight-heading: 700;.\nHydejack now uses lazy-loading hy-img tags instead of regular img tags. To revert to using regular images, set hydejack.no_img in the config file to true.\nCookie consent is now stored as a cookie (instead of LocalStorage) and expires after 1 year.\nScrolling to a fragment link is now smooth.\nFont loading now works differently, and will be cancelled on slow connections.\nThe sidebar content is now centered.\nThe sidebar will now show the site’s logo, which can be set in the config file under the logo key.\n[PRO] Updated embedded Bootstrap to v4.\n[PRO] Project cards now throw a shadow instead of having a border.\n\n\n\n\n\nPages can now have the cover key in the front matter. When set to true, the sidebar will be opened when visiting the page directly. E.g. https://hydejack.com/{:.no-push-state}\nAdded a _plugin that automatically replaces &lt;img&gt; tags with lazy-loading &lt;hy-img&gt; tags. If you don’t want images to load lazily, delete or rename the _plugins folder. Note that this plugin will never run when building the site on GitHub Pages.\nTo get the most out of this plugin, it is recommended to provide the width and height of the image, e.g.\n![Some image](assets/img/some-img.png){:data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\"}\nThis will cause hy-img to render a placeholder of 800 by 600 px, preventing the document height from changing after the image has finished loading.\nAdded experimental offline support via Service Workers. Use with care! For details, read the docs.\nAdded the figure CSS class, which allows images to have nicer-looking captions. E.g.\n![An image with a caption](https://placehold.it/800x50){:.lead}\nA caption to an image.\n{:.figure}\nClicking on a footnote will give its corresponding text a subtle highlight.\n[PRO] Projects can now have an optional end_date field in the front matter. The date is treated as the start date in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back button now works in combination with fragment links."

    "text": "Oct 24 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\n\n\nThe free version of Hydejack is now GPL-3.0 licensed, which is a more restrictive license than MIT (but still Open Source). This was necessary because the two major components that make up Hydejack, hy-push-state{:.external} and hy-drawer{:.external}, are now GPL licensed in turn.\nHow will this affect you? * If you bought the PRO version you are not affected at all. * You can continue to use previous versions of Hydejack according to their license (MIT). * If you upgrade, keep the source code in a public repository and make sure you include the new LICENSE.md file. DO NOT publish the new code with an old license. * If you upgrade and make changes to the source code, you are required to make those changes available to the public under a GPL-3.0 compatible license.\nThe full license text is available here. You can read a summary on tl;drLegel.\nIf this change is not acceptable to you, DO NOT upgrade or consider buying a PRO license.\nNote that the above does not constitute legal advice.\n\n\n\nThis is a major release, but almost all options and APIs that were described in the docs continue to work. Some names have changed and are no longer mentioned in the docs, but they are still part of the code and continue to work.\nThat being said, you should be aware of these (small) breaking changes:\n\nThe favicon is now located in assets/icons. To change the favicon of the page, edit favicon.ico (png) in the folder.\nChanged the way tables work, so that they do the right thing more often. Tables are now scrollable by default, but small tables are no longer stretched to span the full width. Setting scroll-table on a larger table is sill recommended, as it will set white-space: nowrap.\nAutogenerated ids for posts now look like post-2017-01-01-my-title instead of post-2017/01/01/my-title.\nEvent names described in the scripting chapter have changed from y-push-state-* to hy-push-state-*, except y-push-state-animationend, which has been removed. See the docs for more.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage has been renamed to accent_image, but image continues to work unless you add the jekyll-seo-tag plugin. This change was necessary because jekyll-seo-tag uses the image keyword to set the thumbnail image of a page. While it may be desirable to use the same image for both the sidebar and the thumbnail, the new preferred way to set sidebar images is by using the accent_image key.\ncolor has been renamed to accent_color to be consistent with the new accent_image key, but color continues to work.\nVarious options that do not make sense outside the context of Hydejack (like no_push_state or no_drawer) have been moved under a common hydejack key. However, the old options continue to work.\nhydejack:\n  no_push_state: false\n  no_drawer: false\nAll plugins (gems) are now optional. The gem-based version of the theme no longer uses any plugins by default, while the download version follow a “batteries-included” approach and enables some by default.\nLinks to the /assets/ folder are no longer intercepted by the push state features, which means clickable images and download links should work fine now.\nReader views in Firefox and Safari have an easier time recognizing the main content.\nInternal No more &lt;style&gt; tags in the body.\nInternal Content that is generated via JS (error pages, loading, etc…) is now cloned from template tags, where it is easier to modify (but before you do, check out the new _data/strings.yml file).\nInternal Changed how CSS code is organized. Previously there were two versions of each CSS file for each ‘topic’, one containing core styles to be inlined into the page, the other containing those fetched asynchronously via link tag. Now there is only one file per topic, with the parts to be inlined/linked marked with comments. A script has been added to “split” the CSS into the inline/link parts. Note that this does not affect your my-*.scss files.\nInternal Many CSS classnames have changes, specifically those that would conflict with Bootstrap class names.\nInternal Many files in _includes have been reorganized, specially head.html and body.html have been broken up into smaller parts.\nInternal The y-drawer component (MIT) has been replaced with the hy-drawer component (GPL-3.0).\nInternal The y-push-state component (MIT) has been replaced with the hy-push-state component (GPL-3.0).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme now has support for the jekyll-seo-tag plugin. To use this gem, make sure you use the latest Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and run bundle install. In your config file, add jekyll-seo-tag to plugins (formerly called gems).\nAll texts that were previously hard-coded into the theme can now be configured via _data/strings.yml. This makes it possible to change certain phases without having to change source files, but it should also make it easier to use Hydejack with other languages. Time and date formats can also be configured, using Ruby’s format directives.\nThe lang key now accepts values like en-us or de_AT.\nMade the site “mobile web app capable”\n\nAdded manifest.json for “Add to Homescreen” support on Android\nAdded theme-color meta tag that matches the accent_color and changes dynamically\nAdded apple-mobile-web-app-* meta tags\nAdded ieconfig.xml for “Pin to start menu” support in Windows 10.\nOld icons and new ones are now located in assets/icons.\n\nHydejack now marks up content as structured data, to the extent possible. The resume is provided as https://schema.org/Person as well as hCard, while projects are provided as https://schema.org/CreativeWork. You can use the Structured Data Testing Tool to see the results.\nIf you do not want to expose your data in machine-readable form, you can set the no_structured_data flag to true in your config file.\nhydejack:\n  no_structured_data: true\nNote that this only applies to the resume and project layout, not the data generated by by jekyll-seo-tag (Facebook Open Graph and Twitter cards).\n[PRO] Added “big projects”. You can make a project card span the entire content width (instead of half), by setting big_project to true in the project’s front matter.\n[PRO] The welcome layout now has a content_separator option, which allows content to move below the “Selected/Latest Projects” and “Selected/Latest Posts” section. Usage:\n---\nlayout: welcome\ncontent_separator: &lt;!--more--&gt;\n---\n\nContent above\n\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n\nContent below\n[PRO] The PRO version now has built-in support for Tinyletter. To show a newsletter subscription box below each post, set tinyletter: &lt;username&gt; in your config file. If you want to use a different mailing provider, you can add your own form in _includes/my-newsletter.html.\n[PRO] The PRO version now includes styles for input elements, using the same CSS class names as Bootstrap. Check out the Bootstrap docs to learn more.\n[PRO] Added links to random posts at the bottom of each post. This can be beneficial for search engine rankings and content discovery. You can remove them with the new post_addons option (see below).\n[PRO] If a endDate is missing in your resume.json, it will render as “&lt;startDate&gt; – present”. You can change the wording in the new strings.yml file.\nAdded support for jekyll-avatar. If this plugin is enabled in your config file, it will show the avatar of your github account (author.social.github, author.github.username author.github).\nAdded support for jekyll-gist.\nYou can now add links to external sites in the sidebar. Create a file like something.md and add a title, menu, order (optional) and a redirect_to field to the front matter, e.g.:\n---\ntitle: External\nmenu: true\nredirect_to: https://example.com/\n---\nYou may combine this with the jekyll-redirect-from plugin to generate a redirect page, but this is optional.\nYou can now configure the order of complementary content below posts and projects. By default, Hydejack will show the author first (if any), the newsletter box next (if any), and related posts/projects last.\nhydejack:\n  post_addons:    [about, newsletter, related, random]\n  project_addons: [about, newsletter, other]\nTo change the order in the output, change to order in the array. You can also drop entries from the output by removing them from the list.\nAdded an error page that is shown when client-side network errors occur. It contains a link to retry loading the page. Previously, the browser’s default error page would have been shown.\nAdded hide_description option to pages to prevent the content of description fields to show up in the output. This allows you to use the description field in the front matter to set descriptions for search engines and sharing on social media, without having to worry about the output.\nYou can activate this for all pages by adding to your config file:\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: ''\n    values:\n      hide_description: true\nAdded a new option called no_inline_css. When true, Hydejack will generate a single CSS file to be fetched (synchronously) via link tag, instead of inlining half and including the rest via link tag.\nThis option may be useful when serving content over HTTP/2, but you should perform your own tests. For more on inlining CSS, see this.\nhydejack:\n  no_inline_css: true\nAdded dns-prefetch links to Google Fonts and Google Analytics domains to further boost page load speed. These are only included when using Google Fonts/Analytics.\nYou can now define an arbitrary CSS background for the sidebar instead of just images, e.g.:\naccent_image:\n  background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(35,62,76,1) 0%,rgba(60,146,158,1) 50%,rgba(213,213,212,1) 100%) #4fb1ba'\nCategory and tag pages can now have arbitrary content (to be shown above the list).\nLinks can now be marked for FLIP animations by adding the flip-title class. Use this for links that have the exact same text as the title of the page they are linking, e.g. [NOTICE](NOTICE.md){:.heading.flip-title}.\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced building time during development. Roughly 50% of the time was spent rebuilding the inline CSS, which is now built once and included via link tag. Production builds still inlines CSS, so the building speed remains unchanged. For more on how to improve building speeds, see here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default background image is no longer anti-selling the theme…\nCode blocks, math blocks and tables now use as much space as there is available on the screen. Limiting the line length makes sense for paragraphs, as they are more difficult to read when they span the entire length on a large display, but it is less useful for content, like tables, long formulas or code.\nIf you do not like this change, you can set no_break_layout to true in your config file.\nhydejack:\n  no_break_layout: true\nMargin below code blocks, math blocks and tables increased from 1rem to 2rem.\nGray text now has a higher contrast ratio: I don’t want anybody to “suffer from design”.\nReduced the number of responsive breakpoints.\nAdded a hover effect on project images.\nOn mobile, footnotes will be shown as [1] instead of superscript, making them easer to tap.\nThe sidebar now has a subtle shadow on mobile, to indicate that it can be drawn from the side.\nThe sidebar now has less margin on the sides.\nThe sidebar now fits 5 social media icons, up from 4.\nThe description in the sidebar now has a smaller font size when it is longer than 100 characters. This is to encourage writing a longer description for search engines (~160 characters).\nh1, h2 and h3 headings now have different line-heights to improve readability when they span multiple lines.\nMarks on external links are now less opaque, but have a hover effect.\nMore responsible usage of font_heading in resume layout.\nWhen hovering over a headline, a # link will appear, so that readers can link to individual headlines.\nChanged the loading spinner to use a single icon instead of several animated divs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen linking to an internal document that doesn’t match the regular content structure, the ‘hot replacement’ will no longer get stuck, and reload the page instead.\nFix jumping to # links after navigating to a new page.\nFix jumping to # links in MS Edge.\nFixed a bug on iOS were scrolling was blocked after closing the drawer.\nFixed a bug where the image used during the project FLIP animation would note be replaced with the higher resolution image after the animation in certain browsers.\nThe drawer is now less likely to be opened by accident."

    "text": "Jul 27 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nThis maintenance release includes various quality-of-life improvements when using the gem-based version of the theme.\n\n\n\nHydejack now uses additional Jekyll plugins by default, which make working with GitHub more convenient. They have been added to the Gemfile and _config.yml. Note that existing users need to update their _config.yml:\ngems:\n  - jekyll-default-layout # new\n  - jekyll-feed\n  - jekyll-optional-front-matter # new\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-redirect-from\n  - jekyll-relative-links # new\n  - jekyll-sitemap\nAdded licenses folder that includes the full license texts of licenses mentioned in NOTICE.md.\nYou can, once again, define the author in _config.yml. Using _data/authors.yml is still recommended (and takes precedence), but this option is more convenient when setting up a quick (project-) page using the gem-based theme. Also, a mini-version of _data/social.yml can be provided as part _config.yml, e.g.:\nauthor:\n  social:\n    github: https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack\n    npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydejack\n    download: https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/archive/v6.5.0.zip\n\ndata_social:\n  github:\n    name: GitHub\n    icon: icon-github\n  npm:\n    name: npm\n    icon: icon-npm\n  download:\n    name: Download\n    icon: icon-box-add\nA download icon has been added to the default icon font and _data/social.yml has been updated.\nAdded _includes/my-scripts.html, _sass/my-inline.scss and _sass/my-style.scss to make it easier to add custom scripts and styles without modifying the source. This is especially handy when using the gem-based version of the theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading web fonts now starts earlier and content download no longer blocks swapping out the fallback font for the new font. Previously, a page containing lots of images could have delayed displaying the web fonts significantly.\nThe home layout no longer contains a message suggesting that you don’t use it.\nThe home layout now shows up to 5 blog posts and up to 5 pages blow the regular content.\nThe version history has been moved from docs/&lt;version&gt;/versions.md to CHANGELOG.md.\nThe license notices have been moved from docs/&lt;version&gt;/licenses.md to NOTICE.md.\nUpdated gem and npm dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default font has been changed from “Noto Serif” to “Noto Sans”. If you have a font entry in _config.yml, this will have no effect.\nnap.jpg is no longer used as default background image in the gem-based theme.\nThe sidebar content width is now limited to the width of the sidebar (this only effects large screens).\nProject cards and pagination buttons now have slightly rounded borders for a less “rigid” look.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to use the old font, add the following to _config.yml:\nfont_heading: \"'Roboto Slab', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\"\nfont:         \"'Noto Serif', Georgia, serif\"\ngoogle_fonts: \"Roboto+Slab:700|Noto+Serif:400,400i,700,700i\"\nIf you were relying on the default setting for the background image, add the following to _config.yml:\nimage: /hydejack/assets/img/nap.jpg\nNote that you have to replace /hydejack with your baseurl.\nTo restore the old sidebar, open (or create) _sass/my-inline.scss and add the following:\n@media screen { .sidebar-sticky { left: 2rem; max-width: none; } }\nTo remove the border radius, open (or create) _sass/my-inline.scss and add the following:\n.card, .pagination-item { border-radius: 0!important; }"

    "text": "May 3 2017 {:.heading.post-date}\nHydejack has always featured a JavaScript-heavy sidebar, but other than that, JS has been used sparingly. This changes with this release, which adds a ton of (optional) code that changes the feel of the theme dramatically.\n\n\nPages are now loaded and swapped through JavaScript. This has a number of effects. First of all, it looks cool, but the animations aren’t just about aesthetics: They also help to hide the network time of fetching the next page, making the entire site feel faster. At the same time, the FOUC introduced in the last release will no longer occur (except on the initial page load).\n\nMost JS is now unified in the _js directory and written in ES2016.\nThe blog-by-tag layout has been renamed to list.\npublic folder has been renamed to assets to make the theme compatible with Jekyll’s gem-based themes.\nTags are now supported via Jekyll Collections instead of _data.\nThe sidebar can now add links to all kinds of pages.\nCategories are now supported.\nAuthor information moved to _data/authors.yml\nAdded support for multiple authors.\nUsing jekyll-feed plugin (supported on GitHub Pages) instead of custom solution.\nAdded about layout.\nAdded not-found layout.\nAdded redirect layout\n\nSee the the migration guide for instructions on how to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nThe “accent” font (heading font) is now used for all headings. This gives the theme a “bolder” look and was necessary for the animation: link =&gt; heading.\nChanged default text font from “PT Serif” to “Noto Serif”.\nAdded CSS classes for styling markdown content.\nLinks have a new style. They now always display an underline to make the choice of the link color less critical (darker colors were hard to distinguish from regular text).\nMade social media icons larger and easier to tap.\nSocial media icons are now also part of the “about” sections of a post.\nAdded support for a copyright notice at the bottom. Can be set via the config variable copyright.\nChanged responsive breakpoints and added support for very large displays.\nThe site is now printable.\nThe blog layout now only shows the excerpt instead of the full post.\nLinks to external pages are now marked with a symbol.\nAdded margin above social media icons to prevent accidental tapping\nAdded gem files so that bundle install and bundle exec jekyll serve work\nDisabled HTML minification when running via jekyll serve\nAdded dingbat to signal end of post\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated posts is no longer blank for posts that do not belong to a category.\nFootnotes now use the text version of “leftwards arrow with hook” instead of the emoji on iOS.\nText is no longer invisible while waiting for Google Fonts to load.\nAlways show scrollbar to prevent layout “jumps”"

Future versions might address this, but it is the currency in which loading speed is being payed for and can not be fully avoided.\n\n\n\nHTML, CSS and JS served minified.\nJS downloading starts only after the rest of the page is renderd.\nCritical CSS (above-the-fold) is inlined into the document, the rest is fetched later.\n\nIn order to minify the CSS and make it more modular it has been rewritten in SCSS.\n\n\n\n\nColored focus outline in page color\nTabindex for tab navigation\nSocial media icons easier tappable with finger\n\n\n\n\nNot strictly part of the release, but the images have been blurred to increase text readability and help with loading speed as well (burred images get compressed by JPG much better)."

    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 2. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 3. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 4. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 2. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 3. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 4. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 5. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 2. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or 3. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 4. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or 5. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 6. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 2. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 3. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 4. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 2. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 3. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 4. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 5. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 2. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or 3. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 4. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or 5. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 6. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee."

    "title": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 2. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 3. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 4. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 2. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 3. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 4. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 5. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 2. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or 3. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 4. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or 5. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 6. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow."

    "text": "“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 2. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 3. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 4. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 2. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 3. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 4. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 5. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n{:style=“list-style-type:lower-latin”} 1. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 2. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or 3. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 4. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or 5. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 6. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee."
